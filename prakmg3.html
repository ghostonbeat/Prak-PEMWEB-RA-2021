As chlorophyll gradually disappears from the leaves, they turn to shades of red, orange, yellow, and brown. Many plants make seeds that will become new plants in spring. Some animals grow thicker fur to get ready for the cold winter. Others gain weight to prepare for a deep sleep called hibernation to take them through winter.

Many trees survive by losing their leaves and lying dormant, or inactive, during this chilly season. Some animals enter a deep sleep called hibernation to help them save energy and survive winter. Other animals migrate, or move, to warmer regions. People need to heat their homes and wear thicker clothes to keep warm. The freezing winds often bring snow and ice.
